How does if form?\\xa0It forms under clear, cold nights in winter time. The temperature when water vapour in the air transforms into water droplets, or ice crystals, is called dew point temperature. When water vapour in the air comes into contact with an object, whose temperature is below freezing and dew point, hoar frost forms. Hoar frost forms as a result of direct desublimation, which means directly from water vapour to ice crystals, without the liquid water droplets phase. How does it get its beautiful appearence?Its feathery structure is due to that the freezing process is so quick that it traps air, giving it a white appearance. Fun info (not from Yumei): The word ‘hoar’ comes from old English and refers to \"old\" or \"grey\"* and the way the ice crystals form makes it look like white hair or a beard.\\nHow does it affect the road condition?Hoar frost is a common and hazardous form of road slipperiness, across a road network. The presence of hoar frost reduces road surface friction and leads to slippery road conditions. This may reduce the mobility of the transport system and cause traffic accidents.\\xa0How can Klimator help the road users?Based on machine learning, rule-based algorithms, and vast amounts of data, Klimator aims to give accurate and reliable hoar frost forecasts so road users can plan their driving. But also -\\xa0to winter road maintenance engineers, who can plan maintenance activities in advance and ensure the safety and mobility of the transportation system.

In general for the winter maintenance industry in Europe, Grip (or friction) is the most used method for follow up on performed actions. Using the anti-spin and ABS traction control sensors - the cars can calculate and estimate the average friction value in My and give an overall view if the maintenance event fulfill the quality aspects defined by the customer. The data can also be used to find locations where lack of grip is more common compared to surrounding areas.\\nRoad Status Information is a MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support Software) that support the winter maintenance industry with hyper local road weather forecasts. The vision with the RSI software has from the beginning 2013 been to support the transformation within the industry with a high focus on automatization, route optimization and adaptive salting.\\nIn the RSI MDSS is all available data are already integrated in the solution. Today we can offer Floating Car Data from a number of suppliers depending on which data is most relevant to our customers. Grip estimation (Friction), calculated from regular vehicles is used for follow up and evaluation of actions.\\nGrip measurement, made by i.e. NiR-lasers or AHEAD - technology is used for Adaptive salting and also as an input to road weather model and forecast. 1. Road Weather Forecast - preparation for snow fighting\\nThe picture above illustrates a heavy weather event in Sweden the past winter. Icy roads that will be affected by snow the upcoming 12-14 hours. Actions are needed over several hours to fight the icy and snowy roads. 2. Collection of production data - with new treatment action forecast\\nThe picture above shows production data from contractor. The historical production to the left - and upcoming preventive actions to the right based on performed actions combined with how the weather evolves over time. 3. Grip - measurement and evaluation of activities with NiR - Lasers\\nThe picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by NiR-lasers or Klimator AHEAD technology. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The contractor handled the situation almost perfectly - the road map is almost in the yellow area. There are some minor segments that measures friction below 0,35 My, and in the box up to the left - the contractor can use different input sources. In this case - grip measurement with latest treatment action on the actual segment. 4. Grip - Calculation and evaluation of activities by cars The picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by Volvo. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My.

How does if form?\\xa0It forms under clear, cold nights in winter time. The temperature when water vapour in the air transforms into water droplets, or ice crystals, is called dew point temperature. When water vapour in the air comes into contact with an object, whose temperature is below freezing and dew point, hoar frost forms. Hoar frost forms as a result of direct desublimation, which means directly from water vapour to ice crystals, without the liquid water droplets phase. How does it get its beautiful appearence?Its feathery structure is due to that the freezing process is so quick that it traps air, giving it a white appearance. Fun info (not from Yumei): The word ‘hoar’ comes from old English and refers to \"old\" or \"grey\"* and the way the ice crystals form makes it look like white hair or a beard.\\nHow does it affect the road condition?Hoar frost is a common and hazardous form of road slipperiness, across a road network. The presence of hoar frost reduces road surface friction and leads to slippery road conditions. This may reduce the mobility of the transport system and cause traffic accidents.\\xa0How can Klimator help the road users?Based on machine learning, rule-based algorithms, and vast amounts of data, Klimator aims to give accurate and reliable hoar frost forecasts so road users can plan their driving. But also -\\xa0to winter road maintenance engineers, who can plan maintenance activities in advance and ensure the safety and mobility of the transportation system.

In general for the winter maintenance industry in Europe, Grip (or friction) is the most used method for follow up on performed actions. Using the anti-spin and ABS traction control sensors - the cars can calculate and estimate the average friction value in My and give an overall view if the maintenance event fulfill the quality aspects defined by the customer. The data can also be used to find locations where lack of grip is more common compared to surrounding areas.\\nRoad Status Information is a MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support Software) that support the winter maintenance industry with hyper local road weather forecasts. The vision with the RSI software has from the beginning 2013 been to support the transformation within the industry with a high focus on automatization, route optimization and adaptive salting.\\nIn the RSI MDSS is all available data are already integrated in the solution. Today we can offer Floating Car Data from a number of suppliers depending on which data is most relevant to our customers. Grip estimation (Friction), calculated from regular vehicles is used for follow up and evaluation of actions.\\nGrip measurement, made by i.e. NiR-lasers or AHEAD - technology is used for Adaptive salting and also as an input to road weather model and forecast. 1. Road Weather Forecast - preparation for snow fighting\\nThe picture above illustrates a heavy weather event in Sweden the past winter. Icy roads that will be affected by snow the upcoming 12-14 hours. Actions are needed over several hours to fight the icy and snowy roads. 2. Collection of production data - with new treatment action forecast\\nThe picture above shows production data from contractor. The historical production to the left - and upcoming preventive actions to the right based on performed actions combined with how the weather evolves over time. 3. Grip - measurement and evaluation of activities with NiR - Lasers\\nThe picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by NiR-lasers or Klimator AHEAD technology. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The contractor handled the situation almost perfectly - the road map is almost in the yellow area. There are some minor segments that measures friction below 0,35 My, and in the box up to the left - the contractor can use different input sources. In this case - grip measurement with latest treatment action on the actual segment. 4. Grip - Calculation and evaluation of activities by cars The picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by Volvo. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The example comes from an ongoing heavy snow fall, and the collected data represent the past 12 hours.\\nRead more about Klimator AHEAD - technology\\nFeatured articles\\nDynamic operations - contact Klimator for more information\\nRead more articles Enhancing Winter Road Maintenance with BIG DATA.

How does if form?\\xa0It forms under clear, cold nights in winter time. The temperature when water vapour in the air transforms into water droplets, or ice crystals, is called dew point temperature. When water vapour in the air comes into contact with an object, whose temperature is below freezing and dew point, hoar frost forms. Hoar frost forms as a result of direct desublimation, which means directly from water vapour to ice crystals, without the liquid water droplets phase. How does it get its beautiful appearence?Its feathery structure is due to that the freezing process is so quick that it traps air, giving it a white appearance. Fun info (not from Yumei): The word ‘hoar’ comes from old English and refers to \"old\" or \"grey\"* and the way the ice crystals form makes it look like white hair or a beard.\\nHow does it affect the road condition?Hoar frost is a common and hazardous form of road slipperiness, across a road network. The presence of hoar frost reduces road surface friction and leads to slippery road conditions. This may reduce the mobility of the transport system and cause traffic accidents.\\xa0How can Klimator help the road users?Based on machine learning, rule-based algorithms, and vast amounts of data, Klimator aims to give accurate and reliable hoar frost forecasts so road users can plan their driving.

In general for the winter maintenance industry in Europe, Grip (or friction) is the most used method for follow up on performed actions. Using the anti-spin and ABS traction control sensors - the cars can calculate and estimate the average friction value in My and give an overall view if the maintenance event fulfill the quality aspects defined by the customer. The data can also be used to find locations where lack of grip is more common compared to surrounding areas.\\nRoad Status Information is a MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support Software) that support the winter maintenance industry with hyper local road weather forecasts. The vision with the RSI software has from the beginning 2013 been to support the transformation within the industry with a high focus on automatization, route optimization and adaptive salting.\\nIn the RSI MDSS is all available data are already integrated in the solution. Today we can offer Floating Car Data from a number of suppliers depending on which data is most relevant to our customers. Grip estimation (Friction), calculated from regular vehicles is used for follow up and evaluation of actions.\\nGrip measurement, made by i.e. NiR-lasers or AHEAD - technology is used for Adaptive salting and also as an input to road weather model and forecast. 1. Road Weather Forecast - preparation for snow fighting\\nThe picture above illustrates a heavy weather event in Sweden the past winter. Icy roads that will be affected by snow the upcoming 12-14 hours. Actions are needed over several hours to fight the icy and snowy roads. 2. Collection of production data - with new treatment action forecast\\nThe picture above shows production data from contractor. The historical production to the left - and upcoming preventive actions to the right based on performed actions combined with how the weather evolves over time. 3. Grip - measurement and evaluation of activities with NiR - Lasers\\nThe picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by NiR-lasers or Klimator AHEAD technology. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The contractor handled the situation almost perfectly - the road map is almost in the yellow area. There are some minor segments that measures friction below 0,35 My, and in the box up to the left - the contractor can use different input sources. In this case - grip measurement with latest treatment action on the actual segment. 4. Grip - Calculation and evaluation of activities by cars The picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by Volvo. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The example comes from an ongoing heavy snow fall, and the collected data represent the past 12 hours.\\nRead more about Klimator AHEAD - technology\\nFeatured articles\\nDynamic operations - contact Klimator for more information\\nRead more articles Enhancing Winter Road Maintenance with BIG DATA.

In general for the winter maintenance industry in Europe, Grip (or friction) is the most used method for follow up on performed actions. Using the anti-spin and ABS traction control sensors - the cars can calculate and estimate the average friction value in My and give an overall view if the maintenance event fulfill the quality aspects defined by the customer. The data can also be used to find locations where lack of grip is more common compared to surrounding areas.\\nRoad Status Information is a MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support Software) that support the winter maintenance industry with hyper local road weather forecasts. The vision with the RSI software has from the beginning 2013 been to support the transformation within the industry with a high focus on automatization, route optimization and adaptive salting.\\nIn the RSI MDSS is all available data are already integrated in the solution. Today we can offer Floating Car Data from a number of suppliers depending on which data is most relevant to our customers. Grip estimation (Friction), calculated from regular vehicles is used for follow up and evaluation of actions.\\nGrip measurement, made by i.e. NiR-lasers or AHEAD - technology is used for Adaptive salting and also as an input to road weather model and forecast. 1. Road Weather Forecast - preparation for snow fighting\\nThe picture above illustrates a heavy weather event in Sweden the past winter. Icy roads that will be affected by snow the upcoming 12-14 hours. Actions are needed over several hours to fight the icy and snowy roads. 2. Collection of production data - with new treatment action forecast\\nThe picture above shows production data from contractor. The historical production to the left - and upcoming preventive actions to the right based on performed actions combined with how the weather evolves over time. 3. Grip - measurement and evaluation of activities with NiR - Lasers\\nThe picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by NiR-lasers or Klimator AHEAD technology. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The contractor handled the situation almost perfectly - the road map is almost in the yellow area. There are some minor segments that measures friction below 0,35 My, and in the box up to the left - the contractor can use different input sources. In this case - grip measurement with latest treatment action on the actual segment. 4. Grip - Calculation and evaluation of activities by cars The picture above shows Floating Car Data - collected by Volvo. Yellow is grip above 0,5 My, Orangea is grip above 0,35 My and Red is grip under 0,25 My. The example comes from an ongoing heavy snow fall, and the collected data represent the past 12 hours.\\nRead more about Klimator AHEAD - technology\\nFeatured articles\\nDynamic operations - contact Klimator for more information\\nRead more articles Enhancing Winter Road Maintenance with BIG DATA.

Types of frost include crystalline frost (hoar frost or radiation frost) from deposition of water vapor from air of low humidity, white frost in humid conditions, window frost on glass surfaces, advection frost from cold wind over cold surfaces, black frost without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and rime under supercooled wet conditions.[2]'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Hoar frost is a type of frost that forms when the air is moist and surfaces are cold.
